# TDD-react-simple-counter

This Git repository is dedicated to a simple counter component implemented using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles in React. Each step of the development process is accompanied by a detailed explanation in a Medium article, providing insights into the rationale behind design decisions and the TDD workflow.

## Overview

The counter component allows users to increment, decrement, and reset the counter value, demonstrating fundamental React concepts such as state management, event handling, and component composition.

## Development Process

The development process follows a step-by-step approach guided by TDD principles. Each feature of the counter component is developed iteratively, with corresponding tests written beforehand to drive the implementation process.

## Testing

The repository includes test files written using a testing framework like Jest along with the React Testing Library. These tests serve as executable documentation, outlining the expected behavior of the counter component and ensuring its correctness throughout the development process.
